#EX--print 1...10 numbers

# three imp terms in looping
#1] Initilization,  2] Condition   3] Incrementation.

i=1  #Initilization

while i<=10:    # Condition
    print(i)
    i=i+1       # Incrementation


#Ex-- Print 1....10 numbers in descensing order(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)

i=10

while i>=1:
    print(i)
